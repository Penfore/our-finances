### Code Contributions

#### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` if you're new to the project.

#### Areas Where We Need Help

- UI/UX improvements and Material Design 3 enhancements
- Financial analytics and charting features
- Dark theme implementation
- Performance optimizations
- Testing coverage (unit tests, UI tests)
- Documentation improvements
- Accessibility features
- Internationalization (additional languages)

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use a simplified Git flow:
- `main` - Production ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/bug-description` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/critical-fix` - Critical fixes

### Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

3. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request

## Style Guidelines

### Kotlin Code Style

We follow the [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html):

- Use `./gradlew ktlintFormat` to format your code

- Follow the existing code patterns in the project
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add KDoc comments for public APIs

### Architecture Guidelines

- Follow Clean Architecture principles
- Maintain separation of concerns between layers
- Use dependency injection (manual DI with factory pattern)
